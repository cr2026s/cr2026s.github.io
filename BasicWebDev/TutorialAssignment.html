        <h2>Embedding Videos Into Your Own HTML Document!</h2>
        <br/>
        <div class="steps">
            <h4>Step 1:</h4>
            <p>Create a html document (if you already have a document for this embedded video, skip this step)
            <br/>
            (for this example GitHub will be used, but you can just use a text editor, and save the file afterwards)
            <br/>
            Create the file in whatever folder you want it to be in, when creating a html document, remember the basics! (shown in the image below)</p>

        <div class="steps">
            <h4>Step 2:</h4>
            <p>Save and exit your text editor (optional) and go to YouTube (or another service) to find the video you want to embed (in this example the video is starred)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h4>Step 3:</h4>
            <p>Go underneath the video, and find the share option, near comments, likes and subscribe button (may be different on different sites). Click it and choose the embed option (if it doesn't show up, keep looking through the options, for this example it's the first one). After clicking that code will show up (if no code showed up, there will be a "show code" option, click that) select all of the code, and copy it (ctrl +c)</p>

            <h4>Step 4:</h4>
            <p>Go back to your text editor, and paste the code into it (if you already have a lot in your document, paste it in a spot you'd want it to be) and then save</p>

        <div class="steps">
            <h4>(optional) Step 5:</h4>
            <p>As you can see in the code, some (or all) of it may be familiar, you can use it to change attributes to make the video appear how you want it to (such as changing the height and width)</p>
