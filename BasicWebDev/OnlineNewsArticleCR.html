        <h1>Shed Door Crashed Into</h1>
        <p>Local Culver's employee crashes into the shed door with and electrical bike after leaving to get swiss cheese. This happened because they had been riding towards the shed door, and went for the brakes, but they weren't working. The frame for the door of the shed had to be replaced, thankfully the person who crashed, and the bike (and the cheese!) were unharmed in this accident.<br/><q>One minute I was on my bike, and the next, I was in the shed. That was my first time in the shed, pretty chill in there.</q> <i>This comes from the person who crashed into the shed door.</i> According to a witness, they were, <q>at least 25 miles per hour.</q></p>
