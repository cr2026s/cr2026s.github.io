        <p style="display:block;">Rainy Incorporated is a company founded by two best friends with a dream. They had started the idea of a company October 29th, 2025, more as a project they could spend time together on, they came to enjoy working on this for a while, then on July 12th, 2027, when they finished, and sold their first power tool. They both had an interest in engineering, and designed all of these tools themselves. As their company grew, so did their hearts, with the promotions they have been doing. Rainy Inc. wants to make the world a better place, even they they sell power tools, they take profits and put them into projects all around the world. Examples of projects they have done would be building an entire neighborhood specifically for low-income families (they have done this in multiple different countries so far), they have also helped to repair houses and monuments after natural disasters (all of this while using the tools they made!). The founders of this company help in as many of these projects as they can, because this is their dream. Rainy Inc. is all about the people of the world, and how they can help. Every purchase of a Rainy Inc. power tool adds to their project fund, and anyone can sign up to join them on their projects all around the world!
