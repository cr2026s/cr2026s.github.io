            <img src="Images/mami.jpg" alt="mami"/>
            <p><span style="text-align:center; font-size:20px;">Mami Tomoe</span> <br/>
            her wish was to survive something that happened to her, the downside of this wish would be she didn't recieve anything else.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sayaka">
            <img src="Images/sayaka.jpg" alt="sayaka"/>
            <p><span style="text-align:center; font-size:20px;">Sayaka Miki</span> <br/>
            her wish was for someone else to be healed so they could play the violin again, this gives her faster regeneration than the other magical girls. the downside of this wish would be she used it on someone else, who, once he was healed, didn't want to talk to her anymore.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="kyoko">
            <img src="Images/kyoko.jpg"/>
            <p><span style="text-align:center; font-size:20px;">Kyoko Sakura</span> <br/>
            her wish was for more people to believe in her father's religion. the downside of this wish was once her father found out that she had wished for it, he killed himself and the rest of her family (but not kyoko).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="madoka">
            <img src="Images/madoka1.jpg" alt="marokda kaname"/>
            <p><span style="text-align:center; font-size:20px;">Madoka Kaname</span> <br/>
            her wish was to destroy all witches before they were even born, this (as well as the infinite potential Homura gave her) made her such a powerful magical girl she couldn't exist on the same plane as everyone else (turning into something like a goddess).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="homura">
            <img src="Images/homura1.jpg" alt="homura"/> 
            <p> <span style="text-align:center; font-size:20px;">Homura Akemi</span> <br/> 
            her wish was to redo her her meeting with Madoka, which in turn lets her travel back in time to that moment, and her power for this is being able to stop/slow down time. the downside of this wish is constantly looping in time (and the pressure of getting it right) as well as giving Madoka infinite potential.</p>
